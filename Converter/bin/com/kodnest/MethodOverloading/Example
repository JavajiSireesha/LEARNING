In this example, the Converter class demonstrates method overloading
 for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
 The methods are overloaded based on the data types of their parameters (double and int).
These examples illustrate how method overloading can be used to provide 
a more flexible and convenient interface to your code by accommodating different parameter combinations or data types.
