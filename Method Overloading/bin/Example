In this example, the Calculator class demonstrates method overloading
 by providing different versions of the add method with varying parameter lists (integers and doubles) 
and a separate concatenate method for string concatenation.

Remember that method overloading is not limited to just the number or type of parameters;
 it considers the entire parameter list.
 The method signatures must differ in some way, such as the number, types, or order of parameters.
